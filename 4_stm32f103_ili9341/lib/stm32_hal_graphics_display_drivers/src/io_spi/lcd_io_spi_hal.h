/* Features:
   - only hardware SPI
   - write function 8 and 16bit without DMA or with DMA (in both fill and bitmap mode)
   - write function with bitdepth convert (16bit RGB565 to 24bit RGB888) without DMA or with DMA
   - all writing functions are possible in both fill and bitmap mode
   - read function 8 and 16bit only without DMA or with DMA
   - read function with bitdepth convert (24bit RGB888 to 16bit RGB565) without DMA or with DMA */
